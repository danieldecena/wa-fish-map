Plan approved 2026-09-01 22:19.

Sessions start in "plan" (permissions.defaultMode in
~/.claude/settings.json). Bypass is reachable in the Shift+Tab cycle only
when launched via `cb` (--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions); `yolo`
(--dangerously-skip-permissions) starts in bypass outright.

Only if Claude Code actually closed:

    claude --resume c7aee6b6-3151-406b-a14b-4a5fe813c9b2

(`-c` resumes the most recent session; bare `--resume` opens a searchable picker.)
